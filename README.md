==============

find DS Sudoku Solver on facebook, [HERE](https://apps.facebook.com/dssudokusolver/)

*DS Sudoku solver* is a mini web application that solves the sudoku puzzle.


##Todo
`api.py` is originally intended for solving the sudoku. But it is not yet complete. Instead of solvimg things from server I am going to take a crack at solving it using javascript on the client end, first. And Then I planned to implement the solution at server-end.
